I spend a lot of time thinking about how to compete with [free](http://cloud.feedly.com/). I believe the answer is to change the meaning of the word, so starting today [Feedbin is free as in freedom](https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin). 

I think there are many great reasons to make Feedbin open source, but my main reasons are:

- I want your help.
- I want you to have a say in the future of Feedbin.
- I like transparency and there's nothing more transparent than being able to view source.

Tom Preston-Werner of GitHub wrote a [great article](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html)  outlining some of the pros of open sourcing software and I'm hoping to reap these rewards as well.

Tom does have a caveat though:

> Ok, then what shouldn't I open source? That's easy. Don't open source anything that represents core business value.

I'd say there's nothing more core than the core app, but I don't agree with him on this. In GitHub's case I think there's a huge social network aspect so people aren't going to leave because all their co-workers and colleagues are on GitHub. Also, looking at the [status page](https://status.github.com/messages) you can tell it's not too easy to run something the size of GitHub.

I'm not the first to do this. [NewsBlur](http://newsblur.com/) has been open source since the beginning and is very successful. WordPress is open source too but the company still runs a popular hosted version.

Mostly I'm just excited to see what happens. It should be a cool experiment.

I wanted to thank [Karl Fogel](http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/) for his help making this happen. He literally wrote a book on [producing open source software](http://producingoss.com/) and is in the [process of revising it](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kfogel/updating-producing-open-source-software-for-2nd-ed) so it was great to have him as an advisor. Also thanks to [Alex Kessinger](https://alpha.app.net/voidfiles) and [Samuel Clay](https://twitter.com/samuelclay) for their encouragement and help.
