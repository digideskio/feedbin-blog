Feedbin now includes a full screen mode that makes for an enjoyable reading experience.

You can access full screen through the format toolbar or using the keyboard shortcut `shift + f`.

One of the great things about RSS readers is that they can provide a consistent and customizable reading environment. Feedbin is my favorite place to read on the web and anything that can make it even more pleasant is the best kind of feature.

Thanks to [Dan Mundy for the idea](https://twitter.com/exchgr/status/414201413812899841).
