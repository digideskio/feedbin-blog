Embedded videos from YouTube and Vimeo will now show up in Feedbin.

Why didn't Feedbin always show videos?

I'm glad you asked. Feedbin sanitizes all feed content for security reasons. Feed content is passed through a few different filters using the excellent [html-pipeline][pipeline] by [@jch][jch] and [others][contributors]. This library does some great stuff like [sanitizing markup][sanitizing], [rewriting image sources][camo_filter] to go through an [SSL proxy][camo] and [turning relative links][absolute_source] and image sources into fully qualified URLs.

[sanitizing]: https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/master/lib/html/pipeline/sanitization_filter.rb
[camo_filter]: https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/master/lib/html/pipeline/camo_filter.rb
[camo]: https://github.com/atmos/camo
[absolute_source]: https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/master/lib/html/pipeline/absolute_source_filter.rb

Because of the sanitization all iframes, CSS and JavaScript are removed. One side affect of this is that no video content  would show up since most videos on the web are embedded through iframes. The change today whitelists iframes that load content from YouTube or Vimeo.

If there are any other video hosts you'd like to see whitelisted please [let us know](mailto:support@feedbin.com).
