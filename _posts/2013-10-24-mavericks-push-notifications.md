[OS X Mavericks](http://www.apple.com/osx/) was released on Tuesday and it has a cool feature that allows websites to [send push notifications to your Mac](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/safari-push-notifications/).

Feedbin can now take advantage of this by offering push notifications for new articles.

To set it up you will need to be using Safari 7 on Mavericks. Then visit the [Feeds](https://feedbin.me/settings/feeds) page under Settings and there will be an option to enable push notifications. Click that and choose to allow Feedbin to send push notification in the resulting pop-up.

Next you will need to select which feeds you want to enable push for in the Feed Settings list. It's a per-feed setting because enabling this for all feeds would be overwhelming.

Clicking on a notification will open up the original article and mark the article as read in Feedbin.
