The [Feed Settings](https://feedbin.me/settings/feeds) page has been redesigned.

This refresh has a cleaner and denser look and two new features. The first feature is that you can now sort a feed's last updated date. The second is the feed activity graph that shows post frequency relative to other feeds you are subscribed to.

The last updated date can come in handy if you want to unsubscribe from feeds that haven't been updated in a few years or that may have silently changed feed addresses. The activity graph is great for finding noisy feeds or for some nice looking stats.
