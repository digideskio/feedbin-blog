There is now a $20/year billing option for Feedbin. 

You can change plans at any time and your subscription will be pro-rated, meaning any service you have already paid for will be discounted on your new plan. 

Go to your [billing page](https://feedbin.com/settings/billing) to change plans or [sign up now](https://feedbin.com/).
