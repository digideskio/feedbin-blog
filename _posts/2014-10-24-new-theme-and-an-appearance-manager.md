The new theme is called sunset and it's my favorite look for Feedbin. I associate this color palette with [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) so I feel right at home when using Feedbin on the web or through Reeder on iOS or Mac.

To try this theme out you can visit the new [Appearance settings page](https://feedbin.com/settings/appearance).

In addition to changing the theme, you can also turn on or off summary elements you're not using. The new inline option is great if you have a wide-screen display and want to take advantage of the extra space.

You can also use the format toolbar to quickly switch themes.
