Feedbin now has built in [sharing functionality](https://feedbin.me/settings/sharing).

In order to support every sharing service there is, Feedbin does not include support for any service in particular.

Instead, Feedbin gives you the ability to define your own sharing services. This way you can use your favorite sharing services and not see the ones you don't use.

Most social sites support sharing through a specially crafted URL. For example to share something on App.net, you would visit a URL like: <code>https://alpha.app.net/intent/post?text=${title}+${url}</code>

Feedbin gives you the tokens:

- ${title} The entry title
- ${url} The entry URL
- ${source} The feed name

I've started a list of [sharing service URLs on GitHub](https://github.com/feedbin/support/blob/master/sharing-services.md#sharing-services). Please feel free to add yours.
