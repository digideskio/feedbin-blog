[Reeder 3.1 with Feedbin support](https://itunes.apple.com/app/reeder/id325502379) has just been approved and is available now in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/reeder/id325502379).

In addition to Feedbin support, Reeder has some other great new features like:

- Local/standalone RSS Support
- Pull-to-refresh
- Bug fixes

I've been using the beta since it was available it it has been an RSS lovers dream.
