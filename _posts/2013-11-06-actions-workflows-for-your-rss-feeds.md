[Actions](https://feedbin.com/settings/actions) are a great way to filter out articles you're not interested in or surface articles you want to be sure to read.

Because this is based on search you can use some powerful operations. For example if you're not much of a baseball fan, but still want to see news about your favorite team you could set up an action to mark anything as read that matches `baseball NOT yankees`, which would mark anything as read that matches `baseball` but keep `baseball AND yankees` unread.

If you're using Safari on OS X Mavericks there is a push notification action. This is the new home for configuring push notifications because it makes the old location redundant. All push notifications that were previously set up have been migrated into actions.

If you have not tried Feedbin before, now is a great time to check it out. There's a free [14 day free trial](https://feedbin.com/signup) so it's easier than ever to give it a try.
