The positive feedback and encouragement I've received about Feedbin has been amazing. I couldn't ask for better customers. Thank you.

The top priority is keeping Feedbin running and making sure your feeds are up-to-date.

There are now 56,710 unique feeds to check, which is an exciting problem to have. Luckily this is a task that can be massively parallelized thanks to on-demand server resources. Feeds are staying current, but improvements are still in the works to stay ahead of the growth.

### New Features

There are a number of features customers can't live without, and I wanted to let you know some of what's coming.

- Feed and tag management
- Hierarchical tags
- Importing starred items from Google Reader (hang on to those .json files)
- Import error reporting
- Sharing
- A few surprises

Feedbin is young, and I'm as excited as anybody to watch it mature.
