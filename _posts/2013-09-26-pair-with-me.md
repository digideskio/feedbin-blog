I read Frank Chimero's ["The Inferno of Independence"](http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/09/the-inferno-of-independence/) yesterday. It's a great article, and while I generally have poor reading comprehension, something resonated with me which is that "independence is lonely."

I've been thinking that one thing I miss when working on Feedbin is the opportunity to work with others. [Open sourcing](http://blog.feedbin.com/2013/08/27/feedbin-is-open-source/) Feedbin has helped make the work a bit more social, but I'm still left wanting more.

So I have an experiment I'd like to try.

Do you have an idea for a feature or a bug you would like to fix, but aren't sure how to approach it or you would like to work on it with someone else? If so, why don't we work on it together?

To set something up, just [send me an email](mailto:ben@feedbin.com) with what you'd like to work on and when you're available.

The only thing I would ask is that you already have Feedbin running locally and have [Screenhero](http://screenhero.com/) and [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) installed.
