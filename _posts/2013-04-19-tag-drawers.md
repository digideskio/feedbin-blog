Tag Drawers are rolling out today.

Tag Drawers show you what feeds belong to a tag. Whether you like to keep the drawer closed or open, Feedbin will remember your preference.

To complement Tag Drawers there is a new [setting](https://feedbin.com/settings) to hide any feed that belongs to a tag from the main feeds list. This is useful if you don't want tagged feeds showing up in two places.
