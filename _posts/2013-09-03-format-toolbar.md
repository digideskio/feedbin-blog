The format toolbar has some options for styling the look of articles. There's a couple of nice font choices including [Whitney](http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/overview/) and [Sentinel](http://www.typography.com/fonts/sentinel/overview/) both from [Hoefler & Frere-Jones](http://www.typography.com). You can also change the font size and make the text full width.

[Todd is starting to Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/toddjcollins) some Feedbin design stuff so go check out his page to see what's in the works.
