title:  Rediscover RSS

RSS changed how I read online. RSS enabled me to keep up with content from hundreds of websites, and quickly became my number one pastime.

This passion for RSS led me to create [Feedbin](https://feedbin.me). My goal is to create a fast and familiar reading experience that can be used for hours on end. In other words the kind of RSS client I'd want to use.

I believe RSS is still the best way to discover and consume content on the Internet and now Feedbin is the best way to use it.
