RSS changed how I read online. RSS enabled me to keep up with content from hundreds of websites, and quickly became my number one pastime.

This passion for RSS led me to create [Feedbin](https://feedbin.me). Feedbin is the kind of RSS client I want to use. Itâ€™s fast, familiar and can be used for hours on end.

I believe RSS is still the best way to discover content on the Internet and now Feedbin is the best way to use it.
