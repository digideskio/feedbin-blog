You can now import your starred items from Google Reader. 

First [export your Google Reader](https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1#custom:reader) data. Then visit the Feedbin [Import/Export page](https://feedbin.me/settings/import_export) and upload the `starred.json` file from your Google Reader export.

Importing is done in the background so there will be some delay before everything shows up. File size is limited to 75MB, so if you have a larger file please [get in touch](mailto:support@feedbin.me).
