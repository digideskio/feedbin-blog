There's a new section that sits right below Starred called Recently Read.

The idea is that sometimes a glimmer of a memory pops into your head of something you read recently and you desperately try to piece your life back together to figure out "where did I read that thing?"

Recently Read can help you in these types of situations by remembering for you.

Recently Read attempts to only remember articles that you've actually read, not just marked as read. Currently if you stay on an article for more than 10 seconds it will end up here.

It's also a great way to be mindful of what you're actually reading so that maybe you can get a bit of your life back by unsubscribing from those high-volume feeds that you just scan and delete.
