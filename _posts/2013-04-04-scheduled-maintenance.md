Feedbin will be offline starting at [11:00 PDT this Saturday, April 6th 2013](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=3&iso=20130406T11&p1=224&am=5). The maintenance window should last a few minutes.

The reason for the maintenance is to upgrade the database server to add more cache capacity. The new database is already configured as a slave to the master database. The downtime is to ensure that the slave is fully caught up before making it the new master.

This upgrade is necessary to keep Feedbin fast but may even speed it up a little.
