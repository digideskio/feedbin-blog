Any search can now be saved for quick access later. To create a saved search, start by searching for something, hit save and give your search a title.

There's a [saved searches API](https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin-api/blob/master/content/saved-searches.md), if you want to do something with the data other than view it in Feedbin.
