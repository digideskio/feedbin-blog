title:  Link Opener for Chrome

This [official extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feedbin-link-opener/naflkhnfmneiigdcphekaemdmeajiand) restores the ability for Chrome users to open article links in a background tab using a configurable keyboard shortcut.

Previously this was possible without an extension, however the Chrome team [recently removed this feature](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456910).

The default shortcut to open a link is `option/alt + v`. This can be customized in Chrome's [Keyboard Shortcuts for Extensions and Apps](chrome://extensions/configureCommands) page.

The [extension is open source](https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin-link-opener-chrome) and ideas for improvements are welcome.

An extension for Safari is not necessary because WebKit still supports the browser API to create background tabs.
